A simple web page that displays the tracklist of a selected playlist in Spotify using the [spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.22.1) library for the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api).
The user will be prompted to enter the URL of the Spotify playlist that they want to display the tracklist for. You can play the song preview, download it to your computer and go to the track through spotify. Once the URL is entered, the web page will retrieve the playlist information and display the tracklist.
With [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.22.1) you get full access to all of the music data provided by the Spotify platform.
