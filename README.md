A simple web page that displays the tracklist of a selected playlist in Spotify using the [spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.22.1) library for the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api).
The user will be prompted to enter the URI of the Spotify playlist (example attached) that they want to display the tracklist for. Once the URI is entered, the web page will retrieve the playlist information and display the tracklist.
With [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.22.1) you get full access to all of the music data provided by the Spotify platform.
